# üõ†Ô∏è **Installation**

## üóíÔ∏è **Requirements**

Please make sure your system meets the following specs:

- [x] **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04+ / Windows 10+
- [x] **RAM:** 32GB+
- [x] **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 2070+
- [x] **VRAM:** 8GB+

??? question "Why these specs?"
    
    **`OmniGibson`** is built upon NVIDIA's [Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) and [Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim) platforms, so we inherit their dependencies. For more information, please see [Isaac Sim's Requirements](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/requirements.html).

## üíª **Setup**

There are two ways to setup **`OmniGibson`**:

- **üê≥ Install with Docker (Linux only)**: You can quickly get **`OmniGibson`** immediately up and running from our pre-built docker image.
- **üß™ Install from source (Linux / Windows)**: This method is recommended for deeper users looking to develop upon **`OmniGibson`** or use it extensively for research. 

!!! tip ""
    === "üê≥ Install with Docker (Linux only)"

        Install **`OmniGibson`** with Docker is supported for **üêß Linux** only.

        ??? info "Need to install docker or NVIDIA docker?"
            
            ```{.shell .annotate}
            # Install docker
            curl https://get.docker.com | sh && sudo systemctl --now enable docker

            # Install nvidia-docker runtime
            distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID) \
                && curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | \
                sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
                && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/$distribution/libnvidia-container.list | \
                sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
                sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2 # install
            sudo systemctl restart docker # restart docker engine
            ```

        1. Install our docker launching scripts:
            ```shell
            curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StanfordVL/OmniGibson/main/docker/run_docker.sh
            chmod a+x run_docker.sh
            ```

            ??? question annotate "What is being installed?"

                Our docker image automatically ships with a pre-configured conda virtual environment named `omnigibson` with Isaac Sim and **`OmniGibson`** pre-installed. Upon running the first time, our scene and object assets will automatically be downloaded as well.

        2. Then, simply launch the shell script:

            === "Headless"

                ```{.shell .annotate}
                sudo ./run_docker.sh -h <ABS_DATA_PATH> # (1)!
                ```

                1.  `<ABS_DATA_PATH>` specifies the **absolute** path data will be stored on your machine (if no `<ABS_DATA_PATH>` is specified, it defaults to `./omnigibson_data`). This needs to be called each time the docker container is run!


            === "GUI"

                ```{.shell .annotate}
                sudo ./run_docker.sh <ABS_DATA_PATH> # (1)!
                ```

                1.  `<ABS_DATA_PATH>` specifies the **absolute** path data will be stored on your machine (if no `<ABS_DATA_PATH>` is specified, it defaults to `./omnigibson_data`). This needs to be called each time the docker container is run!

            
            ??? warning annotate "Are you using NFS or AFS?"

                Docker containers are unable to access NFS or AFS drives, so if `run_docker.sh` are located on an NFS / AFS partition, please set `<DATA_PATH>` to an alternative data directory located on a non-NFS / AFS partition.

    === "üß™ Install from source (Linux / Windows)"

        Install **`OmniGibson`** from source is supported for both **üêß Linux (bash)** and **üìÅ Windows (powershell/cmd)**.
        !!! example ""
            === "üêß Linux (bash)"
            
                <div class="annotate" markdown>

                1. Install [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and NVIDIA's [Omniverse Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/install_workstation.html) 

                    !!! warning "The latest version of Isaac Sim (2022.2.1) has known issues when loading large **`OmniGibson`** scenes. Please install 2022.2.0 instead."

                    For Ubuntu 22.04, you need to [install FUSE](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE) to run the Omniverse Launcher AppImage.

                2. Clone [**`OmniGibson`**](https://github.com/StanfordVL/OmniGibson) and move into the directory:

                    ```shell
                    git clone https://github.com/StanfordVL/OmniGibson.git
                    cd OmniGibson
                    ```
                
                    ??? note "Nightly build"

                        The main branch contains the stable version of **`OmniGibson`**. If you want to be up-to-date with our latest developed (yet not fully tested) features and bug fixes, you can clone from the `og-develop` branch.

                3. Setup a virtual conda environment to run **`OmniGibson`**:

                    ```{.shell .annotate}
                    ./scripts/setup.sh # (1)!
                    ```

                    1. The script will ask you which Isaac Sim to use. If you installed it in the default location, it should be `~/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-2022.2.0`

                    This will create a conda environment with `omnigibson` installed. Simply call `conda activate` to activate it.

                4. Download **`OmniGibson`** dataset (within the conda env):

                    ```shell
                    python scripts/download_datasets.py
                    ```

                </div>

                

            === "üìÅ Windows (powershell/cmd)"

                <div class="annotate" markdown>

                1. Install [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and NVIDIA's [Omniverse Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/install_workstation.html)

                    ```shell
                    git clone https://github.com/StanfordVL/OmniGibson.git
                    cd OmniGibson
                    ```

                    ??? note "Nightly build"

                3. Setup a virtual conda environment to run **`OmniGibson`**:

                    ```{.powershell .annotate}
                    .\scripts\setup.bat # (1)!
                    ```

                    1. The script will ask you which Isaac Sim to use. If you installed it in the default location, it should be `C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\AppData\Local\ov\pkg\isaac_sim-2022.2.0`

                    This will create a conda env with `omnigibson` installed. Simply call `conda activate` to activate this environment.

                4. Download **`OmniGibson`** dataset (within the conda env):

                    ```powershell
                    python scripts\download_datasets.py
                    ```

                </div>


## üåé **Explore `OmniGibson`!**

!!! warning annotate "Expect slowdown during first execution"

    Omniverse requires some one-time startup setup when **`OmniGibson`** is imported for the first time.
    
    ```
    [Warning] [gpu.foundation.plugin] Waiting for compilation of ray tracing shaders by GPU driver
    ```
    
    The process could take up to 5 minutes. This is expected behavior, and should only occur once!

**`OmniGibson`** is now successfully installed! Try exploring some of our new scenes interactively:

```{.shell .annotate}
python -m omnigibson.examples.scenes.scene_selector # (1)!
```

1. This demo lets you choose a scene and interactively move around using your keyboard and mouse. Hold down **`Shift`** and then **`Left-click + Drag`** an object to apply forces!

You can also try teleoperating one of our robots:

```{.shell .annotate}
python -m omnigibson.examples.robots.robot_control_example # (1)!
```

1. This demo lets you choose a scene, robot, and set of controllers, and then teleoperate the robot using your keyboard.

**Next:** Get quickly familiarized with **`OmniGibson`** from our [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart.md)!


## üßØ **Troubleshooting**

??? question "I cannot open Omniverse Launcher AppImage on Linux"

    You probably need to [install FUSE](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE) to run the Omniverse Launcher AppImage.

??? question "OmniGibson stucks at shader compilation upon startup"

    The process could take up to 5 minutes. This is expected behavior, and should only occur once when you import OmniGibson for the first time.
