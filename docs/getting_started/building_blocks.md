# üß± **Building Blocks**
**`OmniGibson`** ships with many demo scripts highlighting its modularity and diverse feature set intended as a set of building blocks enabling your research. Let's try them out!

***

## ‚öôÔ∏è **A quick word about macros**

??? question annotate "Why macros?"

    Macros enforce global behavior that is consistent within an individual python process but can differ between processes. This is useful because globally enabling all of **`OmniGibson`**'s features can cause unecessary slowdowns, and so configuring the macros for your specific use case can optimize performance.

    For example, Omniverse provides a so-called `flatcache` feature which provides significant performance boosts, but cannot be used when fluids or soft bodies are present. So, we ideally should always have `gm.USE_FLATCACHE=True` unless we have fluids or soft bodies in our environment.

`macros` define a globally available set of magic numbers or flags set throughout **`OmniGibson`**. These can either be directly set in `omnigibson.macros.py`, or can be programmatically modified at runtime via:

```{.python .annotate}
from omnigibson.macros import gm, macros

gm.<GLOBAL_MACRO> = <VALUE> # (1)!
macros.<OG_DIRECTORY>.<OG_MODULE>.<MODULE_MACRO> = <VALUE> # (2)!
```

1. `gm` refers to the "global" macros -- i.e.: settings that generally impact the entire **`OmniGibson`** stack. These are usually the only settings you may need to modify.
2. `macros` captures all remaining macros defined throughout **`OmniGibson`**'s codebase -- these are often hardcoded default settings or magic numbers defined in a specific module. These can also be overridden, but we recommend inspecting the module first to understand how it is used.

Many of our examples set various `macros` settings at the beginning of the script, and is a good way to understand use cases for modifying them!

??? note "Difference bewteen `ParticleApplier/Removers` and `ParticleSource/Sinks`"
    The key difference between `ParticleApplier/Removers` and `ParticleSource/Sinks` is that `Applier/Removers`
    requires contact (if using `ParticleProjectionMethod.ADJACENCY`) or overlap
    (if using `ParticleProjectionMethod.PROJECTION`) in order to spawn / remove particles, and generally only spawn
    particles at the contact points. `ParticleSource/Sinks` are special cases of `ParticleApplier/Removers` that
    always use `ParticleProjectionMethod.PROJECTION` and always spawn / remove particles within their projection volume,
    irregardless of overlap with other objects.

    ```

```

This demo lets you choose a grasping mode and then loads a `Fetch` robot and a cube on a table. You can then teleoperate the robot to grasp the cube, observing the difference is grasping behavior based on the grasping mode chosen. Here, `physical` means natural friction is required to hold objects, while `sticky` means that objects are constrained to the robot's gripper once contact is made. 

??? code "grasping_mode_example.py"

    ``` py linenums="1"
    --8<-- "src/examples/robots/grasping_mode_example.py"

    ```

## üß∞ **Simulator**
These examples showcase useful functionality from **`OmniGibson`**'s monolithic `Simulator` object.

??? question "What's the difference between `Environment` and `Simulator`?"

    The [`Simulator`](../../reference/simulator) class is a lower-level object that:
      
      * handles importing scenes and objects into the actual simulation
      * directly interfaces with the underlying physics engine

    The [`Environment`](../../reference/environemnts/base_env) class thinly wraps the `Simulator`'s core functionality, by:

      * providing convenience functions for automatically importing a predefined scene, object(s), and robot(s) (via the `cfg` argument), as well as a [`task`](../../reference/tasks/task_base)
      * providing a OpenAI Gym interface for stepping through the simulation

    While most of the core functionality in `Environment` (as well as more fine-grained physics control) can be replicated via direct calls to `Simulator` (`og.sim`), it requires deeper understanding of **`OmniGibson`**'s infrastructure and is not recommended for new users.

### **State Saving and Loading Demo**

    * Understanding how to interact with objects using the mouse
    * Understanding how to save the active simulator state to a file
    * Understanding how to restore the simulator state from a given file

??? code "sim_save_load_example.py"

    ``` py linenums="1"
    --8<-- "src/examples/simulator/sim_save_load_example.py"
    ```
